Q.1 write a program to show stack operation using array
.
Q.2 implement stack using linked list
.
Q.3 sort the element of a given stack by only using another stack and push, pop opertaion.

Q.4 How can you implement two stacks in a single array, where no stack overflows until no space left in the entire array space?

Q.5 Design a stack using queue
.
Q.6 implement a Doubly linked list using Stack(As much you required)
.
Q.7 implement Queue using array.

Q.8 implement Queue using linked list.

Q.9  Given two integer sequences, one of which is the push sequence of a stack,
 please check whether the other sequence is a corresponding pop sequence or not. 

For example, if 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a push sequence, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1 is a corresponding pop sequence,
 but the sequence 4, 3, 5, 1, 2 is not.
Q. 
10 implement a queue using stack(as much as required).
