Q.5 Given a linked list and two integers M and N. Traverse the linked list such that you retain M nodes 
then delete next N nodes, continue the same until end of the linked list. 
      
Input: M = 2, N = 2 Linked List: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8 Output: Linked List: 1->2->5->6 

Q.6 Write a program to print elements of a singly linked list in reverse.

Q.7 write a prograam that will delete any duplicates node from the linked list.
 
Q.8 Given a linked list and a number k. Reverse every k nodes in the list. 
Example : Input 1->2->3->4->5->6 and k = 2 Output 2->1->4->3->6->5.

Q.9 Given two linked lists, insert nodes of second list into first list at alternate positions of first list. 
eg. 1->5->7->3->9    6->10->2->4, 
       the first list should become 1->6->5->10->7->2->3->4->9 
and second list should become empty.

Q.10 Write a C function that moves last element to front in a given Singly Linked List.
